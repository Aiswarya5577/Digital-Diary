### Project Description
The Digital Diary is a modern journaling application designed to help users securely record their daily thoughts, events, and memories. It offers features like password protection, cloud backup, multimedia support (photos, voice notes, and doodles), and an intuitive search function.

### The Problem statement
Traditional paper diaries are prone to damage, lack security, and are difficult to organize or search. A digital diary aims to solve these issues by providing a secure, easily accessible, and searchable platform for users to record and manage their personal thoughts, events, and multimedia entries efficiently.

### The Solution
Say goodbye to lost pages and nosy siblings! A digital diary keeps your secrets safe with passwords, lets you add photos and voice notes, and even reminds you to write.
